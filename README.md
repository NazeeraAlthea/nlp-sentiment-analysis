# NLP Sentiment Analysis

This project performs **sentiment analysis** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.  
Sentiment analysis helps computers understand human emotion in text, which is widely used in applications like review analysis, social media monitoring, and customer feedback analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository includes:
- **Data scraping & preprocessing** (in `scrapping.ipynb`)
- **Modeling & evaluation** for sentiment classification (in `notebook.ipynb`)
- **Requirements file** for replicating the environment

Typical workflow:
1. Collect and clean text data
2. Vectorize or embed the text
3. Train a sentiment classification model
4. Evaluate performance and analyze results

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NazeeraAlthea/nlp-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd nlp-sentiment-analysis

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

   * `scrapping.ipynb` — data collection and cleaning
   * `notebook.ipynb` — training and evaluating the sentiment model
